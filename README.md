# TheFollower
A simple, cheap and easy to use line following robot for educational use.

An beautiful image will stay **here**.
## Little Background
Line following robots are always a good alternative for learning about the motion, sensing and programming of small mobile robots.
After competing several years on robotics competitions like [Robocup Junior Rescue Line](http://rcj.robocup.org/rescue.html), I decided to build a small and simple robot for everybody to learn and play with this kind of bot. The opportunity came when I partnered up with two friends and their companies to build small line-follower robots for a workshop at the 2016 Arduino Day Event that we hosted.

- [Engenhoteca](www.engenhoteca.com.br), helped me with lasercutting the wood material.
- [Robocore](www.robocore.net), gave all the hardware needed for 20 robots.


## How-to-Build:

Check our [Instructables](http://www.instructables.com/) for the detailed step-by-step instructions of how to assemble one of this robots.

- The files on the DXF's folder are all the parts that you need to have lasercutted to start the building.

- There's also a passive "wheel" that is 3D Printed, at the STL's folder.


#### You have to lasercut:

| Item |  Quantity |
|------|-----------|
| BottomPlate | x1 |
| MiddlePlate | x1 |
| MiddleHolder| x2 |
| MotorHolderA| x2 |
| MotorHolderB| x2 |
| SensorSpacer| x6 |

#### You have to 3D Print:

| Item |  Quantity |
|------|-----------|
| PassiveWheel| x1 |

## Programming

  The programming is pretty straightforward. You must have installed Arduino IDE on your computer, or the program you like to use to upload to an arduino(and arduino-like boards).

  This work is in progress, and all definitely finish this part `later`!

Thanks to my friends:

* [Marcos de Oliveira](https://github.com/marcosdeoliveira), that helped me lasercut and 3d print parts for the 20 first bots.
* [Ivan Seidel](https://github.com/ivanseidel), helped me build the 20 first bots and got me into the Arduino Day 2016 where the workshop was held.
* [Rafael Riciardi](https://www.facebook.com/rafael.riciardi?fref=ts), gave me a hand on assembling the first 20 robots.
* [Vinicius Milani](https://www.facebook.com/viimilani?fref=ts), also gave me a hand on assembling the first 20 robots.
